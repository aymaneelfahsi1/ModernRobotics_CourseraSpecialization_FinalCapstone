Hello there fellow learner!

please run "main.py" script to have the results generated into the specified folders. 

You may find my scientific english a bit challenging. I urge you to understand that it's my very first english scientific capstone



files named like %_final_config.csv are the ones to use with the V-REP sixth scene

I'd like to point out that surely reference trajectory isn't a function of the cases (of Kp and Ki). I just found it helpful to me while coding to generate the reference trajectory at each case folder for ease of accessibility to paths...

if you'd like to contact me about this specialization (or anything else...) here's my email address:    "aymaneelfahsi2003@gmail.com"


Happy learning!

Kp = 0.1, Ki = 0

Same intial and goal configurations as in the wiki page, for both mobile robot and the block

Overshoot occuring just after leaving block's intial position

No convergence as can be seen on the Xerr plotting graph, thus clearly feedforward control not a good option (Kp ~= 0 == Ki), for my configuration however.


The end effector never makes it to the desired goal let-off points and releases the block before reaching it
